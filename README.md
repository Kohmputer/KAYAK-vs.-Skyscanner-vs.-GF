# Understanding the Landscape: Kayak vs. Skyscanner vs. Google Flights
Travelers have several options, with Google Flights and Skyscanner being major contenders. Google Flights shines with its user-friendly interface, clear price trend charts, and flexible date search grids. Skyscanner excels at "Everywhere" searches for budget-conscious travelers, including results for multi-modal journeys with trains. While Kayak offers a comprehensive search engine encompassing airlines and OTAs, it might appear less flexible in date selection compared to its rivals.

## 1.KAYAK 
**Overview**

KAYAK was found in 2004 by Steve Hafner and Paul English.
Their website and mobile application enable people to easily research and compare accurate and relevant information from hundreds of other travel websites in one comprehensive, fast and intuitive display.
In 2013, KAYAK got acquired by Booking Holdings. 

**How does KAYAK generate revenue?** 
KAYAK Software's business model is a **metasearch engine**. This means that it aggregates travel information from various websites and displays it in one place, allowing users to compare prices and services easily.

1. Referrals to travel suppliers and OTAs (distribution revenues)
   - OTAs: eDreams, Kiwi, Expedia (including Hotwire, Hotels.com and CarRentals.com), Priceline.com (including Booking.com), Travelocity, Travel Holdings (including Easy Click Travel and Tourico Holidays), Airtrade International (including Vayama.com) and Airfare.com;
   - OTAs either pay KAYAL a set cost per click (**CPC**), at the time of referral, or a fixed cost per acquisition (**CPA**), if the user eventually completes the acquisition, or as a percentage of the transaction value.
2. Advertising placements on its websites and mobile applications



**Strategic Partnerships** 

Kayak partners with online travel agencies, booking platforms, and travel intermediaries to distribute its travel search results, deals, and bookings through third-party websites, affiliate networks, and distribution channels, reaching a wider audience and expanding its reach and visibility.

**Website** 

Now that we've learned a bit more about KAYAK, let's dive into its [website](https://www.kayak.com/).
In my opinion, KAYAK offers a really user-friendly interface. Let's say we're booking a trip for May from Zurich to London. We can see that KAYAK provides comprehensive search options and filters.

As you can see KAYAK breaks down the price more in depth. 

Some features of KAYAK's website: 
- Comprehensive search options: Kayak offers a wide range of filters and search options to refine flight searches based on preferences such as price, airline, duration, and stops.
- Price alerts: Users can set up price alerts to receive notifications when flight prices drop, allowing them to book at the best possible rate.
- Multi-city search: Kayak allows users to search for multi-city itineraries easily, which is beneficial for travelers with complex travel plans.
- Filter searches by aircraft type: For true aviation geeks searching for specific planes to fly on, Kayak search results allow you to filter by the type of aircraft. By choosing this filter, you can ensure a particular seat configuration, in-flight experience, and other features.
- Search by airline alliance: For travelers who prefer to stick with one airline alliance, you can filter results by your preferred alliance. This makes it easier to use alliance benefits when flying with a participating airline and enables you to pick a flight you can credit towards earning elite status.
- KAYAK Chatbot: Kayak launched new AI features that let people ask a chatbot for travel tips and find flights with just a screenshot.


Questions that came to my mind while analyzing KAYAK's website. 
- Do customers use all the filters? Does the data analytics team investigate which filters are being used?
- How does KAYAK handle users with ad blockers?
- Are these ads served by KAYAK, or are they retargeted by Google using KAYAK as the website?


## 2.Skyscanner

Original Skyscanner search flight page. We can see the heatmap that Skyscanner uses to indicate when prices are low, medium, and high. 
Skyscanner displays a rather classic homepage, simple but presenting a nice invitation to travel, with the "Explore Everywhere" options.

- Explore Everywhere

### Glossary / Important terms in the meta-search engine industry
- **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)**: The CPA indicates a cost, but it is not a payment method. It gives excellent information about the efficiency of an online ad. *CPA = Total spending / Number of conversions*
- **Cost-per-Click (CPC)**: The price an advertiser is charged for each click (traffic) the ad receives. *CPC = Total spending / Number of clicks*
- **effective Cost-per-Click (eCPC)**: This metric is used to show what the CPC would have been if the advertiser purchased clicks instead of impressions or conversions.
- **(CPM) Cost per Thousand/Impression**: Paying on a CPM basis means that advertisers pays KAYAK based on the number of times their advertisements appear on its websites or mobile applications. *CPM = Total spending / Number of impressions* 
- **(CTR) Click through Rate**: When CPM and CPC indicate the cost of advertising, CTR measures its efficiency. Click-through tells you how often users clicked on the ad.  *CTR = (Total clicks / Number of impressions) x 100*

Questions: 
- Do you use the same metric for each partner?
