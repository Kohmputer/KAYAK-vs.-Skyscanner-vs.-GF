# Case Study on KAYAK vs. Skyscanner
This is a writeup on three different technology-driven companies committed to improving online travel. 
The purpose is to investigate how each site compares each other. 

## 1.KAYAK 
**Overview**

KAYAK was found by Cofounders of Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz in 2004 by Steve Hafner and Paul English. 
Their websites and mobile applications enable people to easily research and compare accurate and relevant information from hundreds of other travel websites in one comprehensive, fast and intuitive display.
In 2013, KAYAK got acquired by Booking Holdings. 

**How does KAYAK generate revenue?** 
KAYAK Software's business model is a metasearch engine. This means that it aggregates travel information from various websites and displays it in one place, allowing users to compare prices and services easily.

1. Referrals to travel suppliers and OTAs (distribution revenues)
   - OTAs: eDreams, Expedia (including Hotwire, Hotels.com and CarRentals.com), Priceline.com (including Booking.com), Travelocity, Travel Holdings (including Easy Click Travel and Tourico Holidays), Airtrade International (including Vayama.com) and Airfare.com;
   - OTAs either pay KAYAL a set cost per click (**CPC**), at the time of referral, or a fixed cost per acquisition (**CPA**), if the user eventually completes the acquisition, or as a percentage of the transaction value.
2. Advertising placements on its websites and mobile applications

**Strategic Partnerships** 

Kayak partners with online travel agencies, booking platforms, and travel intermediaries to distribute its travel search results, deals, and bookings through third-party websites, affiliate networks, and distribution channels, reaching a wider audience and expanding its reach and visibility.

**Website** 

So now that we learned a bit more about KAYAK. Let's dive into the KAYAK's [website](https://www.kayak.com/).
In my opinion, KAYAK has a really nice user-friendly interface. Letâ€™s say we're booking a trip for June from Zurich to Seoul. We can see that KAYAK has comprehensive search options.

Kayak launched new AI features that let people ask a chatbot for travel tips and find flights with just a screenshot. This brings Kayak in line with many other travel sites that offer AI services for trip planning and, now, price comparisons.

As you can see KAYAK breaks down the price more in depth. 

Some features of KAYAK's website: 
- Comprehensive search options: Kayak offers a wide range of filters and search options to refine flight searches based on preferences such as price, airline, duration, and stops.
- Price alerts: Users can set up price alerts to receive notifications when flight prices drop, allowing them to book at the best possible rate.
- Multi-city search: Kayak allows users to search for multi-city itineraries easily, which is beneficial for travelers with complex travel plans.
- Explore feature: Kayak's "Explore" feature allows users to find deals on flights to various destinations based on their budget and travel dates.
- Search by airline alliance: For travelers who prefer to stick with one airline alliance, you can filter results by your preferred alliance. This makes it easier to use alliance benefits when flying with a participating airline and enables you to pick a flight you can credit towards earning elite status.
- KAYAK Chatbot: Kayak launched new AI features that let people ask a chatbot for travel tips and find flights with just a screenshot.

Original Skyscanner search flight page. 

Skyscanner displays a rather classic homepage, simple but presenting a nice invitation to travel, with the best offers and promotions of the current month. You can see right from the start the search bar as well as the associated possibilities. Besides, worth noting now, the possibility to compare the best prices of hotels and car rentals.

- Flexible search options: Skyscanner offers flexible search options, including the ability to search for flights without specifying a destination, making it suitable for travelers with flexible travel plans.
